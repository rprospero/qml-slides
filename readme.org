#+TITLE: Qml Tutorial Readme

This is the repository for my QML tutorial.  There's a couple of piece
to take care of before we begin.

* Establish a working environment

For this tutorial, you will need both [[https://www.python.org][Python 3]] and [[https://git-scm.com][Git]]

** Download the repo

From the command prompt, in the convenient directory, run

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone https://github.com/rprospero/qml-slides.git
cd qml-slides
git checkout tutorial
#+END_SRC

This will bring you onto the tutorial branch of the repo, which has all the code that we will be discussing.

** Setup a python virtual environment



* Access the Slides

Once you have a working environment, access [[https://rprospero.github.io/qml-slides/][the slides]] to learn.
